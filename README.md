# CPU Performance Data Analysis

In this project, we perform basic exploratory analysis on data that has been scraped from PassMark and UserBenchmark for CPUs released within the last few decades, which contains information on make and performance for those processors. Given the fierce competition between CPU manufacturers (specifically AMD and Intel), a focus of our analysis was determining if any bias existed in UserBenchmark CPU ratings.

We decided to pursue this project because of our shared interest in computer hardware as well as the broader gaming and technology industries. Moreover, we were curious about what kinds of data regarding various PC parts we would be able to obtain from the Internet, the process and challenges of obtaining them, and ultimately, what insights we as consumers could gain from that information.
