## Set-Up

First, the necessary packages are loaded in.
```{r}
pacman::p_load(pacman, rio, rmarkdown, dplyr)
```

Next, we import our data into a dataframe.
```{r}
df <- import("../data/cpu_cleaned.json")
head(df)
```



## Data Preparation

It's clear that there is a lot of data, much of it being extraneous. Since I want to analyze CPU performance over time, I need to isolate the relevant columns and remove any rows with NaN entries in those columns.
```{r}
df <- df[, c("name", "cpu_mark_rating", "cpu_mark_single_thread_rating", "release_quarter")]
cpu_perf <- na.omit(df)
head(cpu_perf)
```
